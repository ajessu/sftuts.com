title: Porting the Jobeet Tutorial for Symfony2
---

I've started to port the
[Jobeet tutorial to Symfony2](/doc/jobeet/en/index.html "Jobeet tutorial to Symfony2")
(up to day 3 only, at the time of this writing), and it's also
[available on github](https://github.com/ajessu/jobeet-docs "Jobeet tutorial for Symfony2 source code").

I've been doing the Jobeet Tutorial with Symfony2 for a while now, and I'm
[not the only one](https://github.com/search?q=jobeet "Jobeet repos on github")
trying at it.

With the release of
[Symfony Standard Edition](http://symfony.com/download "Download Symfony Standard Edition"),
I'm starting the project all over again, to begin documenting it. I hope to
complete all 24 days (and any help is welcomed) so that it can help new
comers learn Symfony2, just like it helped me many of us to get started
with symfony 1.x.

The work is not finished, far from it, and I can't promise on releasing it day
by day as it was done with the original Jobeet Tutorial, since I don't have
full grasp on all parts of the framework, and some days make take longer
than others to document.

As a side note, if you'd like to contribute, I'd encourage everyone to first
try to help on the
[official Symfony2 Documentation](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs "Symfony2 Documentation source"),
as all the main effort should go there to make those docs as complete and
helpful as possible.

If you still want to help, you're more than welcome to fork the
[Jobeet Docs repo](https://github.com/ajessu/jobeet-docs "Jobeet Documentation for Symfony2 on github"),
and send in any pull requests over!

I'll also make available the
[Jobeet project source on github](https://github.com/ajessu/jobeet "Jobeet source for Symfony2"),
but I will be focusing more on documentation first.

I will be trying to follow all the recommended best practices on the tutorials
(though not all best practices are clear to me yet), but if you see something
that's being done wrong, or a better way to do it, please don't hesitate to
comment it. This is a learning experience for myself as well.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, hit up the comments.
